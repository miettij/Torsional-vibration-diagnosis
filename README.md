This repository is related to the article: "Comparing torsional and lateral vibration data for deep learning based drive train gear
diagnosis". The article has been submitted on the 23rd August, 2022.

The related dataset will be published alongside the article. The dataset contains artificially produced gear faults, measured with numerous accelerometers, torque transducers and rotary encoders at multiple rotating speeds between 250 RPM and 1500 RPM.

The models were optimised with the following hyperparameters:
